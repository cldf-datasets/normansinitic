## Lexical and structural data of Sinitic languages by Norman (2003)

This dataset was extracted from the original article by Norman, providing tabular data that is highly amenable for being rendered in CLDF. 
In addition, we added a small script that allows you to convert the data into Nexus format. This command can be invoked after installing the dataset:

```shell script
$ pip install -e .
$ cldfbench normansinitic.nexus
```
